Hello,

Welcome and thank you for participating in the design of Furnace.
If you are reading this then you have been chosen to create a life.


Here are the rules:
You get to design one character only, so make it good.
The character has to fall under the three character classes listed;
-The games theme is steampunk-

*Victorian Humans (Technitions and tinkerers)
*Machines (Victorian gearwork machines.  not future gundam)
*Mystic Humans (Magic casters)

You get to choose the name with approval,  silly names will be rejected
i.e.  Poop Head, or Shit Bag will not be approved,  think of something cool.

You may choose to use your own name as the characters name under the condition 
that you understand you have no control over the characters story. 

You may direct the general idea of the look.  meaning you can say the character has a pipe,
wears a black suite, is bald,  has a big scar on his face etc.  But the actual art will match
the style of the game and will be approved by the developers.

You get to choose the general stats of the characer; is he/she fast and light,  or a big 
strong brawler.  these choices effect the character in such ways as hit points, walk speed,
jump distance etc.

You may work with the developers to create the special move set.  This is a complicated
proccess and has to fall into the balance of the game.


That's it,  you can do something as simple as a text file with your ideas,  or you can take 
it further by gathering reference from a google image search or scribbling out (doesn't have 
to be good) some of your own ideas.
